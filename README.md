# Modular Vehicle Control for Transferring Semantic Information Between Weather Conditions Using GANs

This repository contains the dataset for the paper [Modular Vehicle Control for Transferring Semantic Information Between Weather Conditions Using GANs (CoRL 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01001).

## Generated Weathers Dataset

The dataset contains generated weathers for 10 different weather conditions using CycleGANs. Each weather condtion contains 3500 images. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://vision.cs.tum.edu/webarchive/wenzel/carla-domain-adaptation/generated_weathers.tar.gz) (1.3 GB).

## Publication
